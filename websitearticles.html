    <p>Patagonia’s website in my humble opinion is a pretty fantastic website. We are visual people and the first thing that you see when you open up the Patagonia website is a moving video clip and graphic filled with color motion. Right in the center of this are text and two rounded buttons you can click on to either watch more of the clip or explore. There is a scrolling effect that happens when you scroll down farther there are square graphics with tags in the middle of used gear, women, etc. And they have nice slightly rounded edges that are visually appealing and look clean and then the words “Stay Out, Stay Dry” pop up as you scroll down. The website is very organized and is easy to find what you want and are looking for, they have super nice graphics with Surf, Climbing, Trail Running, Mountain Biking, etc all with exploring buttons on the bottom right to take you to what you’re looking for. Using the inspect element I looked at the code for the patagonia website looked like they were using HTML elements, all of the code looked clean and modern I could go over parts of the code and it would highlight where it showed up on the website which was pretty cool. Overall Patagonias website is clean, visually appealing, organized well thought out and an excellent example of an excellent website.

    <p>Vivo barefoot’s website is another example of a well done website. When you open up the Vivo Barefoot website graphics of their products (shoes) are on a continual loop where it seems like there is an invisible person scrolling left. This is a cool feature because this showcases different types of shoes that they have such as their hiking boot, and their movement footwear. I really like the layout of their website they use alot of imagery and visual images of their product and their goal. The website when you are scrolling down has recommended for you with images of in little squares of shoes. Also scrolling down is image that you can click that leads to a video of their product. Then when you get to the bottom it has a place to enter you email address. Again for the code I did inspect element, the code looks like its clean and modern that that its the same HTML elements. The colors of the website mostly come form their images and I think that they use great images that complement their product and create a visually appealing website. Overall the Vivo Barefoot website is an extremely visually appealing website that compliments the companies vision and goals.

    <p> Super 1 Foods is an example of a website that is pretty bad. The first thing that I notice when I open up the website for super 1 is how much empty grey space that there is with a blinding ugly red bar at the top of the website. Then as you scroll down the website which takes you abut half a second to scroll to the bottom and then yoru done you see the unnatractive faunts that pop out in a red that clashes horribly with the grey background. The in my opinion unnatractive and horrible images that they have have this weird shading at eh bottom of the image which gives it this weird floating affect that is neither sensible or visually unappealing. Using inspect element again I looked at the code of the super 1 website, I saw that it had html lang = en-US” and class = old-ie. So I know that it is html but im not sure if it is the most current html5. It didint seem like it has as many things to explore int eh inspect element as the other two websites had. Overall I think that the super 1 foods website was pretty dismal. From their terrible fonts to unattractive imagery and color pallets super 1 foods website is an excellent example of a terrible website.
