    <ul>


        <li><a href="https://vermont.gov">Vermont</a></li>

        <p>Rank #1</p>
        <p>This is my favorite website because I think it is the most visualy appealing out of all the websites. I like the simple logo and the huge picture of the fall trees. I thought it was eye pleasing and it leaded quickley and was easy to navigate as well as found things easily. Also it works well in multiple screen sizes. </p>

        <li><a href="https://oklahoma.gov">Oklahoma</a></li>

        <p>Rank #2</p>
        <p>This is my second favorite website because I think that it has the best logo for sure and is the second most visually attractive website. It was also eye pleasing and easy to navitage but I thought that vermont had better important links in its homepage. This website also worked well in multiple screen sizes. </p>

        <li><a href="https://tennessee.gov">Tennessee</a></li>

        <p>Rank #3</p>
        <p>Tennesse's website falls into the ranking of third because it wasnt as visually appealing as vermont and oklahoma but i thougt that it was more visually applealing than iowa and alaska and had a decent eye catching red logo in the top left. It was also easy to navigate and was super organized. Lastly this website worked well in multiple screen sizes </p>

        <li><a href="https://iowa.gov">Iowa</a></li>

        <p>Rank #4</p>
        <p>Iowas website comes in fourth becase I think that it is one of teh least visually appealing websites and wasnt too easy to navigate. It was just super unnatractive and didnt look near as clean as the other websites. This website did work well in multiple screen sizes which is why this websige is ahead of alaska. </p>

        <li><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></li>

        <p>Rank #5</p>
        <p>Alaska ranks last for me because lets face it that websie was increadably unnatractive and ugly. It had decent organization and was okay to find your way through the website but I found that the design was super dull. Lastly this webside did NOT work well in multiple screen sizes so it wouldnt work on larger or mobile screens.</p>

    </ul>
