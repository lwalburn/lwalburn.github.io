    <h1><a href="https://www.godaddy.com"> Go Daddy </a></h1>
    <p> Go Daddy is one of the top results when searching web hosting sites. Go Daddy says that its services are free to create a website, but does have plans and pricing. When I was exploring this site I really liked the layout and how simple it looked to get started. It had 100's of templates, as well as tons of fonts and color options to make it your own, and lastly it had a launch and promote tools to attract and keep customers. This website definately would appeal to a small business owner for the fact that its free and gives you quality tools do help build your website for your business. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get online for free, forever</li>
        <li> Fast </li>
        <li>Secure</li>
        <li> Easy to search domain names </li>
        <li>20 million customersr</li>
        <p>Go Daddy offers services such as these.</p>
        <li>Domains</li>
        <li>Websites</li>
        <li>SSL Security</li>
        <li>Web Hosting</li>
        <li>Word Press</li>
        <li>Office 365</li>
        <li>Website Design Services</li>
    </ul>


    <h1><a href="https://www.squarespace.com"> Squarespace </a></h1>
    <p> Squarespace is another web hosting site that I explored through. Squarespace has a 14 day free trial with no credit card required. You get a free custome domain name for the first year of an annual website plan. Other options are to make a free logo, as well as options to help you get your website so that you can sell online. Squarespace would be a good option for a small business but I think that go daddy is a better otion because its completely free and from exploring what each has to offer they seem pretty similar.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Award-Winning Templates</li>
        <li> Blogging</li>
        <li>Portfolios</li>
        <li>Website Analytics</li>
        <li>Get A Domain</li>
        <li>Build your own Brand</li>

    </ul>



    <h1><a href="https://www.hostgator.com"> HostGator </a></h1>
    <p> HostGator is another web hosting site that scales from easy to expert. HostGator is $2.75/mo. This hosting service has a tone of hosting options free SSL certificate, easy WordPress installs, and a free domain for a year. This hosting site has a variety of different web hosting plans the cheapest from $2.75/mo up to $89.98/mo for its Dedicated Hosting option. Hostgator in my opinion for a small business just starting out wouldnt be worth the cost with the free option of go daddy that has similar options and tools available and for a small business owner I think the free easy to use godaddy website would ge my number one option. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Free domain regrestration for a year</li>
        <li>Free site transfers </li>
        <li>Unmetered bandwidth</li>
        <li> 99.9% uptime guarantee</li>
        <li>One-click installs</li>
        <li>Free SSL certificate</li>

    </ul>
