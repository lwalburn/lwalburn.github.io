            <p><img src="seasons.jpg" class="tide"> I am from the seasons
                That never ends
                They repeat their memories
                Repeating them selves
                Dead branches white snow
                Blue sky the sun’s glow
                Red leaves the winds blow
                Green grass the river’s flow
                These bewitching seasons enamor me no end
                Memories tug at my soul
                In their depth I blend
                Besotted by seasons I am
                They leave me in jam
                Clocks turn, Seasons change
                Memories and moments one can’t exchange
                Accepting each season
                Approaching each moment
                I breathe in cold frigid air
                And exhale warm clouds
                Seasons are happy
                Seasons are sad
                Seasons are beautifully mad
                I am from the seasons
                That never ends
                They repeat their memories
                Repeating themselves.
